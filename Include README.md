### Welcome

Hello!

Thank you for showing interest in our dataset **"INCLUDE: A Large Scale Dataset for Indian Sign Language Recognition"**



### Description

The dataset contains 4292 short video files of ISL practitioners demonstrating over 263 word signs from 15 different word categories. INCLUDE is recorded with the help of experienced signers to provide close resemblance to natural conditions. A subset of 50 word signs is chosen across word categories to define INCLUDE-50 for rapid evaluation of SLR methods with hyperparameter tuning.



### Categories

For ease of download and hosting, we have split the entire dataset into several zip files at the category level.

The categories are as follows 

(The number in the parentheses indicates how many parts the category is split into)

1. Adjectives (8)
2. Animals (2)
3. Clothes (2)
4. Colours (2)
5. Days and Time (3)
6. Electronics (2)
7. Greetings (2)
8. Home (4)
9. Jobs (1)
10. Means of Transportation (2)
11. People (5)
12. Places (4)
13. Pronouns (2)
14. Seasons (1)
15. Society (3)



### Dataset Preparation

1. To access the complete dataset, simply select all the .zip files and extract them to a specified directory
2. Upon extraction, the files will be ordered by category.
3. A folder called Train_Test_Split is also included. This folder contains CSV files with the training and test splits for two separate datasets (INCLUDE and INCLUDE-50)



### Thank you

We hope that our INCLUDE and INCLUDE-50 datasets will help you in your research of Indian Sign Language.
